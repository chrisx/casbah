2.0b2 / 2010-11-09 
==================
  
  * Added documentation build script
  * Moved loading of ConversionHelpers from Connection creation to instantiation of Commons' Implicits 
    - This means conversions are ALWAYS loaded now for everyone
  * Added registered conversion for Product (tuples) which fixes open issues with serialization
  * Migrated Conversions code from core to commons, repackaging as com.mongodb.casbah.commons.conversions   
    - Unit Test remains in Core as it uses core code to test loading/unloading which is fine for buildtime tests
  * Moved Logger from core to commons, package changed from com.mongodb.casbah.util.Logging to com.mongodb.casbah.commons.Logging

  * Removed references to package bridge in README and updated with info on each component
  * Fixes #18 corrected pop implementation
  * Fixes #13 - added findAndModify / findAndRemove
  * Fixes #19 Added full support for geospatial query.  Needs some docs and tests
  * - Updated to Java 2.3 driver #12
  * Fixes #2 - ElemMatch works much like $not

  * Fixes #17 added $rename and fixed a bug caused by $or implementation
  * References #4 , some scratch work towards creating a context bound
  * Fixes #1, added $each target and improved $addtoSet impl $each is a bit of an unfortunate stray in that it CAN be invoked elsewhere but should only work with $addToSet
  * Culled useless version javadoc cruft & added @seen to all bareword query ops
  * Fixes #3 Resolved an issue where the $or wasn't being broken into individual documents as expected.  Should be heavily tested.
  * Fixes #15, Wrap the return of operator calls in a DBObject constructor.
  * Fixed anchoring on CoreOperators - things like $mod and such needed to be callable
  * $mod was just flat out wrong - corrected.
  * Fixes #3 - Added $or operator with proper right-hand array creation.
  * Added @see linkage to each core operator's doc page
  * Fixes #10, added $slice operator
  * New Spec test for GridFS, ported from old tests and now using Mongo powered by logo
  * Removed 'batchSafely' methods as they are now deprecated and counterindicated
  * Renamed 'safely' methods to 'request' as they are NOT safe and 10gen convention is moving off 'safe' as a term.
  * Configuring output of SXR crosslinking
  * Added additional test for explicit and cast conversions of Maps to DBObject
  * Removed 'Package Bridge' and DeprecatedTypeAliases code.  Migration guide will be provided instead.
  * - moving 'bridge' code to a bridge package  which may or may not get   used
  * - Added SXR source builds
  * Changed publishing to Scala Tools... Obviously you need credentials there which are maintained outside the project
  * Updated project to cross build for 2.8.1.RC4 as 2.8.1 is coming soon. We will crossbuild going forward for 2.8.0 and 2.8.1.
  * 
  * Tweak README, add note about novus' prior sponsorship.
  * Updated README addressing start of move to MongoDB space
  * Migration of codebase for 10gen ownership   - Package changed from com.novus.* to com.mongodb.*     * Package aliases provided for bridging so you shouldn't need to migrate your 1.0 or 1.1-snapshot code forcibly right away   - Copyright updated to include 10gen   - Version changed from 1.1-SNAPSHOT to 2.0-SNAPSHOT     * Because of package change and modularisation 1.1 will be replaced with a 2.0 release
  * Cull casbah-mapper.  Mapper now lives as an independent project at http://github.com/maxaf/casbah-mapper ...
  * bumped version of scala-time to the 0.2 release
  * publish POM-s
  * stop spamming the logs when JodaDateTimeDeserializer is a NOOP
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:novus/casbah

  * - First pass at a DBList implementation
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:novus/casbah
  * - Migrated Logging into core and out of commons - Fixed an issue with Bareword Query operators not functioning due to where they were placed.
  * added @Ignore, @Key(pri: Int), and better logging of exceptional conditions
  * forgot to unwrap option from propValue
  * added ensureID: a method that'll make sure an object mapped with @ID(auto=true) has an ObjectId
  * added support for top-level type hints
  * make them pay attention when enums aren't properly declared
  * added helpful fall-back conversions which are supposed to catch aped version of scala-time to the 0.2 release
  * publish POM-s
  * stop  "just make it happen" conversion
  * report malformed props that are claimed as enums
  * much saner publishing over SFTP
  * added support for Scala enums
  * type hints only carry through on non-iterable props; better unwrapping of parameterized types
  * added support for Set-s
  * improved fetching of type params; added more helpful error reporting
  * report location of MissingMapper exceptions
  * test
  * force-fed a very contrived example that better exercises polymorphic lists/maps
  * added a timing test case; fixed deserialization bug uncovered by accident during performance testing
  * HALF_UP rounding is required in the math context
  * - Forward port from 1.0.8.1 bugfix branch     * Factory & Builder for MongoDBObject always return as DBObject     * Unit test for reported issue
  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:novus/casbah
  * added ability to specify strategy for turning non-string Map keys into strings
  * disabled parallelExecution because it confuses SSH key passphrase entry prompts while publishing
  * - Added "safely" and "batchSafely" resource loaning methods on Collection & DB     * Given an operation, uses write concern / durability on a single       connection and throws an exception if anything goes wrong.
  * - Adjusted boundaries on getAs and expand; the view-permitting Any was   causing ambiguity issues at runtime with non AnyRefs (e.g. AnyVal). - Fixed an assumption in expand which could cause runtime failure - Updated MongoDBObject factory & builder to explicitly return a type;   some pieces were assuming at runtime that it was a   MongoDBObjectBuilder$anon1 which fucked things up beyond all   recognition - New basic spec test for MongoDBObject, just validates expand behavior   ATM
  * defend Option[_] props from nulls that crop up w/ missing keys
  * rsync publishing is cool
  * moved common deps into common subproject base class
  * Merge branch 'master' into mapper
  * replaced with MongoCursor from master
  * mapper spec runs
  * Typo in the BaseImports for GRidFS was aliasing MongoConnection to GridFS; fixed.
  * Merge branch 'master' into mapper
  * moved mapper stuff into own module
  * merged in re-org work from master
  * - Fixed Type parameters on DeprecatedTypeAliases - Removed old_tests/ConversionSpec as this has been replaced with a new,   cleaner test
  * failing test case narrows down issue with default values in constructor bodies
  * added def _id: Option[ObjectId] which DWIM
  * protect Option fields from nulls
  * choose correct impl when writing to Map props
  * trace logging was causing NoSuchElementException-s on val-s
  * exposed propValue
  * will demand whaaambulance in case of missing mappers
  * polymorphic lists work using selectively persisted type hints
  * Bridge package for the old package space - attempts to throw warnings  when people use the name while still allowing most of their code to  compile.
  * Functioning Specs port of the Conversions unit test, much better test now as well.
  * RichPropertyDescriptor#idProp is now an Option
  * Full module breakdown of Casbah.
  * keep Unix user name in rsync destination
  * exercising case class support
  * added support for BigDecimal
  * added support for Map-s
  * prettier names
  * added support for annotated val-s
